Requirements
    - docker (to run the planners in the Lightweight Automated Planning ToolKiT)
    - python3 (optional, to run the planning.domains solver script). See requirements.txt for dependencies.
    - all code was developed and tested on MacOS but should equally work on all major commercial operating systems
    - diff, vim + vimdiff plugin for diffing the planners output across directories (optional)

# Run the planning.domains planner
./scripts/run.py src/dungeon-domain.pddl src/problem1.pddl | python -m json.tool -

# Run all the local planners 

docker pull lapkt/lapkt-public # to run only once to download the docker image
docker run -v /path/to/this/directory:/dungeon -it lapkt/lapkt-public
cp /dungeon/run_local_planners.sh .

# Run the planners
