2) domain and problem models in PDDL

A list of the names and/or URLs of existing PDDL domain models (if any) that you have used to help you create it;
  
• A description of how you produced it, and what tools, if any, you used (e.g. a text editor, itSIMPLE, planning.domains);
• A short description of the meaning of each operator schema in it, even if some were imported from some other domain model;
• A very short comparison of the performance of the planners you have used to create solutions. 
To do this, use and refer to the planning literature, to results of IPCs where they have competed if appropriate, 
and with reference to how the planners performed on the planning problems you set.

3) output of 2 planning engines that run on the PDDL models
